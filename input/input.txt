History
After the independence of India, Ranaghat was chosen to be the district capital of Nadia, but later Krishnanagar city was selected instead.

Ranaghat has existed since the British invaded India. The most likely origin for the name of the town comes from Rani (Queen) or Rana (a Rajput warrior) and Ghat (steps leading to the river). A myth is still prevalent that the name of the town came from the bandit 'Rana Dacoit', who used to pillage this area five or six hundred years back and he used to give pujas to the goddess Kali to thank her.[2]

A large percentage of the population are the families of Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, who fled during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 with Pakistan. There are also many families who had extensive ties to foreign investments in the town. Ranaghat also played an important role in the Indian struggle for freedom.[3]

This is the home town of some notable Bengali people. Film actress Raakhee Gulzar was born and brought up in a refugee colony in Ranaghat.[4] Athlete and olympian Soma Biswas is from Ranaghat. Poet Joy Goswami was brought up in the town near Chotobazar area. Krishna Panti was known as one of the "5 Great Noblemen of Bengal." He and his descendants the Pal-Chaudhuri family donated land and built many of the town's temples. He was given the title Pal-Chaudhuri and became Zamindar over a huge area of Nadia. Employing Scottish architects, he built palatial buildings, temples and gardens, which are some of the only such buildings in the region to remain mostly intact.[citation needed]
